# INShAck challenges

This folder lists all the challenges for the 2017 INShAck edition. It also lists the exploits and writeups for the challenges we made. 

## How to add a challenge? (for InSecurity member)

```bash
$CHALL_POINTS = 50        # it can be changed later don't worry
$CHALL_NAME   = "whynot"
$CATEGORY     = "crypto"  # look at the folders name to choose your category
cp -r sample/samplechallenge-100 $CATEGORY/$CHALL_NAME-$CHALL_POINTS
```

This repository will be released at the end of the competition, so please try to **make it clean**.

To add a challenge you have to write an exploit (in exploit/exploit.py). It will be used:
* to monitor the challenge during the competition
* as a writeup reference at the end of the competition

Please check all the other files too (writeup.md, src/instructions, public-files/instructions, flag.txt)

Thanks a lot for your contribution! :D
If you have any question or need help to write your exploit, please ask!!
